# Java Data Structures

Code projects from Data Structures (CIS113) at Antelope Valley College in Spring 2019, 
taught by Nathan Wonnacott BSCS, using the [zyBooks.com Data Structures textbook](https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/DataStructuresEssentialsR51)

Adding info and notes after all the projects are added
